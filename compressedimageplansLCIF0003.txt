NOTE: SUBJECT TO CHANGE IN FUTURE, THIS IS A INCOMPLETE DOCUMENT

YET TO BE IMPLEMENTED:
LCIF-0003 : suggestion: multiple color modes that modify 00 and 01, modes are RGB RGBA MONO VAR
LCIF-0003 : fromwhat metainfo, says what image format it encoded from
LCIF-XXXX EN : RRAW2 4 bytes color 1 byte amnt of repeat bytes 0-255 repeat bytes, makes SPVC-hyper slower but is less hard on disk 
LCIF-XXXX DE : make it use disk for the love of god
LCIF-0003 : number offsetting by 2 for repeat stack, 0 is now 2 and 1 is 3, 10 is 4 and so on, makes 1 bit numbers useful for repeat stack
LCIF-0003 : redefine varstack meta meta, if 0 then dont incl varstack or varstack counter, if 1 then incl varstack conuter 8 bits offset by 1 to 1-256 vars, 0 already defined
LCIF-0003 : MONO mode : pulls varstack, 00 is 4 bit var, 01 is 8 bit var
LCIF-XXXX DE : RRAW2, decodes from lcif to RRAW2 file and then loads from generator to make image



LCIF-0003 : GOAL : take color differential to save space on gradient maps
NOTES : this specification uses number offsetting of binary values, in simple terms when it encodes it takes X - Y = input and then on the decoder it takes input + Y = X, this is used to encode the numbers 2 and 3 as 0 and 1 in binary for the repeat counter, a +2 offset, to lower the amount of space it takes, because realistically you would not want a repeat counter to repeat 1 or 0 times, number offsetting is also used in the variable count meter with a +1 offset

1. 64 bits of text defining the filetype and version, it would be L(ossless)C(ompressed)I(mage)F(ile)0003(the version(you only get 9999 versions))

2. there would be a byte, 8 bits of metametadata:
  2 bits go to defining the color mode, 00 is RGBA, 01 is RGB, 10 is VARiable, and 11 is MONO. (explained further) 
  
  
3. there would be 2/1 bytes, 16/8 bits to further compress the metacode (referred to as M)
  the first 1 defines the slice pattern, i have vertial and horizontal, horizontal=0, vertical=1
  the next 1 tells if there will be 256 values in the varstack, if this is 0 there would not be the 8 additional bits defining the amount of vars, so if it is 0 there are 0 vars and if it is 1 there are the 8 bits, offset by +1 to acheive a range of 1-256 in 8 bits
  the next 6 define the size of the resolution chunk, max of 64 in 6 bits so it defines as valXval for the res (ex if val is 10 the resolution chunk is 10for x + 10 for y, 20 bits), this adds support for up to 2^64x2^64
  the next 8 define the amount of variables (not existant if bit M[1] == 1), a problem in 0001 was pictures with less than 256 colors had wasted varspace so this tells the amount of vars
4. there would be 4 bytes that define X1-5 for the 10 instruction, these numbers tell the binlens of the recursive functions 5 number slots (bitlens of each number: 5 6 7 7 7, makes 32 bits or 4 bytes)
5. there would be X bits after the first 64+16 bits that get split into 2 X numbers as x and y of the image, there would be no definition needed, this means the color is defined as one big line and whenever it hits the end of the x it would reset, newline, and add one to y
6. then X*32 bits that allocate 32 bits each for X variables (of len 32, RGBA) (if vars is 0 there are none)

summary of metadata = 64 bit filetype and version, 16/8 bit metametadata (8 if M[1] == 1), 5 instruction 10 bytes, 2M[2:8] resolution, (32*M[8:16] | 256*32 (if M[1] == 1)) bit variablestack
* = changed from 0002
//SAMPLES ARE FOR 0002
//meta sample : 1(vertical)0(uses 0-255 vars)001111(resolution chunk size (15x15 bits))00110011(amount of vars used (51))[5 instruction 10 bytes][resolution bits (15x15)][varstack (51*32)]
//sample 2 : 1(vertical)1(256 vars)001111(resolution chunk size (15x15 bits))[5 instruction 10 bytes][resolution bits (15x15)][varstack (256*32)]

RGBA instructions:

  00 (instr 0) = would refer that a variable color is about to be made
   \0 = defines 4 bit color (from variablestack, the first 16*32 bits would be the most common colors ever in the image)
   \1 = defines 8 bit color (from variablestack)
  
* 01 (instr 1) = would refer that a color is about to be made
*  \00 = defines 8 bit monochrome color (for when r==g==b)
*  \01 = defines 15 bit differential color, this takes the previous color and adds up to 0xf f f or takes up to 0xf f f from that color, 15 bits for 1 bit plus or minus R 4 bit R, 1 bit + or - G, 4 bit G, 1 bit +- B, 4 bit B
   \10 = defines 24 bit RGB color
   \11 = defines 32 bit RGBA color
   
RGB instructions:



Instructions that remain the same regardless of color mode:

* 10 (instr 2) = would define a recursive color function (for multiples of the same color (it wont define the color but instead rely on the next defined color as its input, so its just a number, an instruction 00 or 01 must be after this)) forgot to mention the number of bits is used to count how many bits to read for the number
*  \0 = defines as X1 
*  \1 = branch point (branch moved from 0002 to further compress low repeat counts)
*   \00 = defines X2
*   \01 = defines X3
*   \10 = defines X4
*   \11 = defines X5
* SPECIAL NOTE: because the only 2 valid instructions after a repeat counter are 00 and 01 instead of the instruction being 2 bit it is only 1 bit, 00 being 0 and 01 being 1, this saves a bit for every repeat counter used.

  11 (instr 3) = represents end of colorstream, this will be at the end to tell the code to stop reading because there may be more random bits at the end to get to a byte boundary
*  \0 = yes end colorstream
*  \1 = prints next 8 bits to console as its byte value and continues reading after, if you want to make the decoder talk while decoding now you can

map of slice patterns
0 (horizontal, LCIF-0001 default)
   0 1 2  
   3 4 5
   6 7 8
1 (vertical)
   0 3 6
   1 4 7
   2 5 8

keep in minds for the encoders: (this doesnt need to make sense to someone making a decoder)
  use slice patterns to determine common color variables instead of just the raw counts of common colors
  use direct filewriting and readning to lower memory footprint
  use RRAW (repeat raw) that uses 20 bytes per color, 16 bytes for a 128bit count of the amount of times it repeats and 4 for the rgb value, this can save disk space when going from raw to LCIF
