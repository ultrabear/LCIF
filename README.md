# LCIF file format

welcome to the front page of the LCIF project, this is a file format i have developed over 8 months and am finally putting on github for public use, its strength lies in low color images, where the 0002 standard is getting ever closer to beating the compression of PNG

UPDATE 2020-24-1: added V1.1.1 0002 encoder and V1.1.2 0002 encoder
