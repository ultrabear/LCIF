LCIF-0002 : GOAL : help compress smaller images and make 2^128 repeat a possibility while making the metadata take up less space
1. 64 bits of text defining the filetype and version, it would be L(ossless)C(ompressed)I(mage)F(ile)0002(the version(you only get 9999 versions))

2. there would be 2/1 bytes, 16/8 bits to further compress the metacode (referred to as M)
  the first 1 defines the slice pattern, i have vertial and horizontal, horizontal=0, vertical=1
  the next 1 tells if there will be 256 values in the varstack, if this is 1 there would not be the 8 additional bits defining the amount of vars
  the next 6 define the size of the resolution chunk, max of 63 in 6 bits so it defines as valXval for the res (ex if val is 10 the resolution chunk is 10for x + 10 for y, 20 bits), this adds support for up to (2^63-1)x(2^63-1) and over 2^125 total pixels
  the next 8 define the amount of variables (not existant if bit M[1] == 1), a problem in 0001 was pictures with less than 256 colors had wasted varspace so this tells the amount of vars
3. there would be 5 bytes that define X1-5 for the 10 instruction, these numbers tell the binlens of the recursive functions 5 number slots, one byte per X1-5.
4. there would be X bits after the first 64+16 bits that get split into 2 X numbers as x and y of the image, the compression encodes in a line so this would be used to know where to start a new Y or X line depending on horiz or vertical encoding
5. then X*32 bits that allocate 32 bits each for X variables (of len 32, RGBA) (if vars is 0 there are none)

summary of metadata = 64 bit filetype and version, 16/8 bit metametadata (8 if M[1] == 1), 5 instruction 10 bytes, 2M[2:8] resolution, (32*M[8:16] | 256*32 (if M[1] == 1)) bit variablestack
* = changed from 0001
meta sample : 1(vertical)0(uses 0-255 vars)001111(resolution chunk size (15x15 bits in this case))00110011(amount of vars used (51))[5 instruction 10 bytes][resolution bits (15x15)][varstack (51*32)]
sample 2 : 1(vertical)1(256 vars)001110(resolution chunk size (28 bits, 14 x 14))[5 instruction 10 bytes][resolution bits (14x14)][varstack (256*32)]

instructions:

  00 = would refer that a variable color is about to be made
   \0 = defines 4 bit color (from variablestack, the first 16*24 bits would be the most common colors ever in the image)
   \1 = defines 8 bit color (from variablestack)
  
* 01 = would refer that a color is about to be made
   \00 = defines a blank (if A=0)
   \01 = defines 8 bit monochrome color (for when r==g==b)
   \10 = defines 24 bit RGB color 8bpc
   \11 = defines 32 bit RGBA color 8pbc
   
* 10 = would define a recursive color function (for multiples of the same color (it wont define the color but instead rely on the next defined color as its input, so its just a number, an instruction 00 or 01 must be after this)) forgot to mention the number of bits is used to count how many bits to read for the number
   \00 = defines as X1 
   \01 = defines as X2 
   \10 = defines as X3 
   \11 = branch point
     \0 = defines X4 
     \1 = defines X5 

  11 = represents end of colorstream, this will be at the end to tell the code to stop reading because there may be more random bits at the end to get to a byte boundary


map of slice patterns
0 (horizontal, LCIF-0001 default)
   0 1 2  
   3 4 5
   6 7 8
1 (vertical)
   0 3 6
   1 4 7
   2 5 8

keep in minds for the encoders: (this doesnt need to make sense to someone making a decoder)
  use slice patterns to determine common color variables instead of just the raw counts of common colors
  use direct filewriting and readning to lower memory footprint
  use RRAW (repeat raw) that uses 20 bytes per color, 16 bytes for a 128bit count of the amount of times it repeats and 4 for the rgb value, this can save disk space when going from raw to LCIF
